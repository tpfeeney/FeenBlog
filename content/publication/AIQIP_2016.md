abstract_short = "Using the institutional data from 2016 we found that incidental adrenal lesions were more likely to be worked up if radiologists wording advocated further workup. We also found that imaging ordered by a PCP was more likely to be followed up than if it was ordered as an inpatient or in the ED. Overall only imaging follow up was performed while biochemical follow up was neglected."
