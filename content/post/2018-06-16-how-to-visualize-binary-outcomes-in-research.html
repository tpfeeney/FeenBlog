<p>In my research I frequently want visualize outcomes over groups. The nature of clinical reserach means that often times outcomes are binary and I want to find the proportion of binary outcomes over groups. This was not straight forward for me, so I decided to make a post about it.</p>

## 3     0       0  0

<p>Now here is where it was tricky for me. If you, like I typically do, work with large data then you will need to extract the components you want. Typically for the specific outcome I am interested in, iâ€™ll use <code>na.omit(df)</code> to restrict to only observations with all outcomes observed; excluding NAs</p>
<p>So once you do that you want to select out the binary outcome you are interested in, and I will be using death as the outcome to evaluate.</p>
