      <description>I saw a post on twitter recently. You can hear about clinical significance a lot if you go to medical oriented conferences dominated by physicians. It is usually a phrase brought up when presenting results that are not &amp;ldquo;statistically significant.&amp;rdquo; This is a way to justify and lend meaning or import to results that otherwise people would blow off. I argue that this is complete malarkey, and I want to talk about why.</description>

      <description>While in my MPH training I had the opportunity to use (in class) both Stata and SAS. They were both great, but it became apparent during that time that serious stat were done with R. Further, visualizations that I saw from R packages like ggplot were just so much prettier than anything I saw in SAS or Stata.
There were no specific classes to learn R during my MPH, but I was able to teach myself by taking free online class, googling answer, and just experimenting with my data and comparing it to other software I already knew.</description>

      <description>What is this blog about and what can I expect? This is my professional site. I am interested broadly in STEM fields and may post on a wide range of topics from paper dissections, discussion of topics, and of course R for statistical analysis.
